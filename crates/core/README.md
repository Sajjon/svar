# Svar

A user-friendly encryption scheme using Security Questions and their answers
to protect some secret, allowing for user to later incorrectly answer some
of the questions and still be able to decrypt the secret.

Unsuitable for protection of highly sensitive data alone, but can be used
in applications willing to trade off some security for usability. The reason
for this is that it is hard to reach a high level of entropy (security) with
the proposed number of questions and answers.

Furthermore, an adversary who knows the victim (close friend or family
member) might know the answers to some of the questions.

```rust
extern crate svar_core;
use svar_core::prelude::*;

/// Number of security questions
const QUESTIONS_COUNT: usize = 4;
/// Minimum number of correct answers required to decrypt
const MIN_CORRECT_ANSWERS: usize = 3;

/// Define your security questions
///
/// ‚ùóÔ∏è It's of the utmost importance that
/// these questions are properly constructed with thorough entropy
/// analysis. This is hard, requires expert knowledge and takes time.
/// The questions below are examples, do not assume they're secure ‚ùóÔ∏è
